# PPG_classification

## This is the implementation of [An imperative diagnostic framework for PPG signal classification using GRU] paper(https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=K8OFSxwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=K8OFSxwAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC) 

Here's how to execute the code 
```
1. Run the ppg preprocess notebook to preprocess the raw signals from the BIDMC-PGG dataset.
2. Use the code in the ppg signal processing to implement the preprocessing techniques that are used in the paper.
3. pppmodel notebook contains the architecture that has been proposed in the paper and uses the pre-processed data.
